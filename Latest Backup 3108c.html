            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;[January 21st, 2013] Congratulations, Mr. President. The 2012 election was surprising, but it was what it was ─ Barack Obama ousted and Mitt Romney elected the 45th and first Mormon President of the United States. Now that you've been sworn in, people are wondering what direction your administration will take.&quot;,

Why, why couldn't the American people see that things like the economy didn't matter (all you needed was a capital empire) when you had countries like Iran and people like Islamic extremist terrorists on this Earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was truly over. Republicans gritted their teeth, this was not unexpected and there was nothing they could do. The race was conceded, the trouble was over. Biden smiled, from his sleeves the odour of populism reeked, seeking to evoke the long-gone days of FDR. Handing the country over to socialists like Bernie Sanders, that's what the Democrats were happy with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had now been a few years.

He was unphased, in fact, as the voting began. The results were predictable ─ the election was his, stolen from Biden, the winner of the popular vote. He would take on one hell of a challenge: to run an administration doomed from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he might have thought he had safeguarded the nation from socialists like Bernie Sanders, the President was in for a surprise in 2020.

Romney was proud of his job and his work ─ he was the President of the biggest nation in the free world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats would fall to radicalism after the defeat of the establishment. They would field the idealist O'Malley but it was to now avail, not against Jeb Bush. The flag of freedom would continue to fly on, and fly on proudly.

            &quot;endingText&quot;: &quot;&lt;h3&gt;There was nothing we could do...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney buried his head into his hands ─ he was so far, yet it felt so close, to achieving victory. To securing world peace. All the people needed to see was that it would only take one more war, one last despot toppled, and then things would be good. Why, why couldn't the American people see that things like the economy didn't matter (all you needed was a capital empire) when you had countries like Iran and people like Islamic extremist terrorists on this Earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was truly over. Republicans gritted their teeth, this was not unexpected and there was nothing they could do. The race was conceded, the trouble was over. Biden smiled, from his sleeves the odour of populism reeked, seeking to evoke the long-gone days of FDR. Handing the country over to socialists like Bernie Sanders, that's what the Democrats were happy with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had now been a few years. Mr. Romney glanced at the nearest TV, playing CNN, after leaving a meeting with some up-and-coming artificial intelligence entrepreneurs. He frowned as he saw he'd be paying more taxes next year, thanks to President Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,

            &quot;endingText&quot;: &quot;&lt;h3&gt;By a Hair's Breadth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney was pacing, from one side to another. The night had just been declared for Joe Biden, but it was close, so close. He chuckled as he thought of all those Congressmen and Senators who had pitted him to fail, who had never had the faith. But it was a competitive election, just still Romney had lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he conceded the election, the President was still in high hopes. He had not the faintest shadow of doubt that this loss was a victory for his foreign agenda, and after all that was all he cared about. There would be no cosying up to Iran in this Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, Mitt sat in his family home in Utah, in the living room. The former President had had it all, and was now a figure of advice to any up-and-coming politician who might want it. What more could he want? He could think of that easily: a Republican party not led by isolationist libertarians such as President Weld, Vice-President Johnson, and Senator Amash.&lt;/p&gt; &quot;,

Only now he wasn't referring to the countless American foreign interventions. The war that was about to be waged by the Republican Party was on the home front, and it was a fight for the country itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney knew he had the backing of the majority of states. He was unphased, in fact, as the voting began. The results were predictable ─ the election was his, stolen from Biden, the winner of the popular vote. He would take on one hell of a challenge: to run an administration doomed from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he might have thought he had safeguarded the nation from socialists like Bernie Sanders, the President was in for a surprise in 2020. But now, in 2024, he had hope. He trusted the rising star conservative from Louisiana, Mike Johnson, to beat Vice-President Ryan as President Sanders dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,

He had won, he saw, and a smile made its way onto his face. But he could see it was far from clear-cut: the margins were razor-thin, and yet again he had lost the popular vote. He was ashamed of it, but he smiled at the thought ─ he had stolen the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the odd-shattering victory doomed Romney's administration from day one. He was forced to cede his ground and soon found out that governing with a Democratic Congress was no easy feat. Gradually, the Middle East frontlines became static, and the men sent there no more than lambs to a slaughter. The failure of the economic agenda that would never be passed could at least be blamed on the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats wanted new faces come 2020, and new faces they did have. But a different kind of new face. Gone was the optimism of Obama as Charlie Crist stepped onto the podium, and glided his way to election on a big tent platform. Romney only looked on in horror as he saw his party divided between the goddamned populist Trump and the establishment, unsure of what course to take next. His approval ratings meant he had to stay silent.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,

The people turned out to vote for their President because they saw how important this election was, a choice between freedom and socialism.\&quot; Mitt was beaming as he spoke ─ he had won, and he had won decisively. America had trusted him for four more years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not possible to say it was smooth sailing from then on, but it was certainly not difficult for Romney. Until the 2018 midterms, a Republican Congress ensured that his projects could go through without much worry, and the protests seen in September 2016 subsided as decisive action was taken on the frontlines. Romney was proud of his job and his work ─ he was the President of the biggest nation in the free world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats would fall to radicalism after the defeat of the establishment. They would field the idealist O'Malley but it was to now avail, not against Jeb Bush. The flag of freedom would continue to fly on, and fly on proudly. Romney did not leave office being exactly popular, but it was indisputable that he had not been a bad president.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,

Even though he only had four years left, it was time for Romney to make it Morning Again in America, and put a decisive end to tyrants in the Middle East. &lt;i&gt;That's what they said.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite all the Romney administration could try, it was impossible to hide their American nightmare. It didn't take too long for the vast electoral fraud to be uncovered by the FBI, and suddenly everyone could see Romney's victory was nothing like Reagan's, it was like Nixon's. He cheated. Cheated the American people.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,
