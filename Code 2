It is unknown who introduced it to the POTUS.</p><p>The next day, POTUS Romney secured an unknown quantity of MDMA from [CENSORED] Congressman [CENSORED]. After the Pentagon meeting concerning Al-Assad revealed his potential incapacity for the office, the FBI contacted the CIA, replaced him with a lookalike, and rigged the election to ensure his loss, winning 232 electoral votes. POTUS Romney was placed in a mental institution. The tragic death of his lookalike was then staged on February 3rd, 2017. Not even VPOTUS Ryan or the First Lady knew.
