He had won, he saw, and a smile made its way onto his face. The result was nonetheless close, and Romney had only edged out a marginal victory in the popular vote ─ but he could breathe a deep sigh of relief, for the night was his, and this time he had actually won.</p><p>But the unexpected victory doomed Romney's administration from day one. He was forced to cede his ground, and soon found out that governing with a Democratic Congress was no easy feat. Gradually, the Middle East frontlines became static, and the men sent there no more than lambs to a slaughter. The failure of the economic agenda that would never be passed could at least be blamed on the Democrats.</p><p>The Democrats wanted new faces come 2020, and new faces they did have. But a different kind of new face. Gone was the optimism of Obama as Charlie Crist stepped onto the podium, and glided his way to election on a big tent platform. Romney only looked on in horror as he saw his party divided between the goddamned populist Trump and the establishment, unsure of what course to take next. His approval ratings meant he had to stay silent.</p>",

The people turned out to vote for their President because they saw how important this election was, a choice between freedom and socialism.\" Mitt was beaming as he spoke ─ he had won, and he had won decisively. America had trusted him for four more years.</p><p>It was not possible to say it was smooth sailing from then on, but it was certainly not difficult for Romney. Until the 2018 midterms, a Republican Congress ensured that his projects could go through without much worry, and the protests seen in September 2016 subsided as decisive action was taken on the frontlines. Romney was proud of his job and his work ─ he was the President of the biggest nation in the free world.</p><p>The Democrats would fall to radicalism after the defeat of the establishment. They would field the idealist O'Malley but it was to now avail, not against Jeb Bush. The flag of freedom would continue to fly on, and fly on proudly. Romney did not leave office being exactly popular, but it was indisputable that he had not been a bad president.</p>",

Even though he only had four years left, it was time for Romney to make it Morning Again in America, and put a decisive end to tyrants in the Middle East. <i>That's what they said.</i></p><p>But despite all the Romney administration could try, it was impossible to hide their American nightmare. It didn't take too long for the vast electoral fraud to be uncovered by the FBI, and suddenly everyone could see Romney's victory was nothing like Reagan's, it was like Nixon's. He cheated. Cheated the American people.</p>",
